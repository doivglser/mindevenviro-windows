# Install

* Make a shortcut on the desktop, right-click, New, shortcut, write powershell and click Next. 
* A new link is created. Right-click on the Powershell shortcut and run as administrator. 
* Type the following line in the Powershell: 

### "Enable WindowsOptionalFeature Online Feature Name Microsoft Windows Subsystem Linux." 

* You may need to reboot. 

* After this setting, enter, in the Microsoft Store, "linux", choose "debian" and install it.

* Run the Debian app, and type in the command line: "sudo apt-get -y -f --fix-missing install git".

* do: "cd /mnt/c/Users/$USER/Documents/" 

* $USER is your User-Name in Windows and you must run your Windows as administrator.

* do: "pwd" you should be in "/mnt/c/Users/$USER/Documents/"

* user@host:/mnt/c/Users/$USER/Documents/ "git clone https://github.com/doivglser/mindevenviro-windows.git" 

* The above step should clone mindevenviro-windows, in to your Documents folder in Windows 10.

* $USER in Windows 10 and $USER in the Debian App may differ.
