<h3 style="color:white;">DESCRIPTION</h3>
<pre style="color:white;">

After installing all the necessary components, I would be happy to anonymize your 
computer. To use Tor in a pstandard circuit, you must first close all interfaces 
and change the MAC address of each interface. "shi3lD2" helps you accomplish the 
mission. Be part of an anonymous network with access to any TOR circuit. Most 
people do not need the Tor Bundle. Use your daily applications and trust Snort 
Port Scanner and ScanOnAccess from ClamAV. The Tor network is like a game in the 
nineties. In those hacker games or movies, they do a tunnel throught an 
Intercontinental connection, from one server to another intercontinental 
connection and so on. After few servers, you reach a exit node. From there 
you ask for a webpage (movie, sound, messaging). This involves all network 
traffic, say: DNS, TCP / IP and UDP requests, which must be redirected. In 
other words, you can have, thanks TOR's transparent proxy configuration, a normal 
Linux or Mac installation on your computer. In Debian GNU/Linux 9, using the 
package manager, apt-get, you can install all the necessary applications, only 
"Cont-Sec" will be missing. To read Anonymous emails, you need 2 free web-mail 
accounts, both from a different server, such as gmx and yahoo, or others. Do 
this with "Cont-Sec". Log in to your volatile account on your computer, and 
download half of the encrypted message from one free email inbox and the other 
part of the free email inbox. "Cont-Sec" uses "shi3lD2" to change the Macs 
before starting the download. After the download in  both mailboxes of Spam 
messages, "shi3lD2" will close all interfaces. "Cont-Sec" downloads Spam 
messages, apparently randomly. To be able to download any unwanted email, you 
have to use the "Cont-Sec-mobile-app" to make an "image matching key". Use a 
smart phone, to compare, via Bluetooth, the availability of HTML, CSS and Java 
code, with a good friend. I explain: The code of the unwanted messages, which 
is used to encrypt the message. Well, you must have some Spam in your two Spam 
boxes, more Spam, better acquisition of the lost code, to build ours daily 
alphabet. The encrypted message creates the Roman alphabet, from matrices, taken 
from the email code that matches its "image matching key". Each matrix represents 
a letter or number. After writing the  message, "Cont-Sec" applies a special cipher 
for each letter and number corresponding to the "Email Code Snippets" that match 
Your "image matching key", made in consultation with a friend. So, first you need 
an "image matching key" with a friend, to create a time  window, in a near or a 
distant future. After that, "Cont-Sec" will begin to decipher the message. The 
GUI "Cont-Sec", shows you at the beginning the "Reader". The first Key goes to 
the "Reader" and the second Key goes to the "Glasses". The "Glasses" are 
transparent and appear after the decryption, over the "Reader". The "Reader" 
deciphers one half of the message, which has spaces in the whole text, and the 
"Glasses" complement the spaces on  the "Reader", deciphering the rest of the 
message. After reading, you can take notes on a toilette paper. "shi3lD2" will 
change the Macs of your device and load the routing table, which redirects "all" 
network traffic to a Tor port, like: 9001. "shi3lD2" will start the network through 
the new route in such a Tor circuit, and that's it!!!

<h2 style="color:white;">"An everlasting harmonic sound"</h2>
<h3 style="color:gray;">... just sound</h3>
<pre style="color:white;">
	
After analyzing the sound environment, to define various environment variables; 
Echoes, underpasses, tunnels, sound boxes, vibrating and less vibrating materials. 
Will I try to create a daydream. Glass windows are always bound to a standard, 
the periphery can be fastened to the window with suction buttons. Say: low 
frequencies (bass and bass drums), medium frequencies (to determine the harmony), 
high frequencies (to determine the harmony), inside as well as outside. From this 
follows the standardization of different models, which allow a perfect personal 
sound center with the environment variables. Thus, in the entire environment an 
interesting sound experience, especially in the perfect sonic and rhythmic 
congruence. A perpetual harmonic sound, which in the so-called sound center, 
will significantly contribute to the enrichment of the sonorous form.
